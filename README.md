**version2** This is the future unstable upstream branch. (currently here is no development)

## Version 2

The main goal of version 2 is a complete rewrite with an API driven development design.
Version 2 is currently freezed, because the future of Contao 3 is unknown and under heavy discussion.
Be patient, the planned features for version 2 will be implemented in version 1. Expecting the API driven development design.
If the future of Contao 3 is clear, the development status of version 2 may be changed.
